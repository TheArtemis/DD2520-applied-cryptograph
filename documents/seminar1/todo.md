# Seminar 1 Preparation

## Before the Seminar

### 1. Prepare by Reading

Read at least:

- **EITHER** 2 papers from the user side
- **OR** 2 papers from the developer side
- **OR** 2 papers from the admin side

### 2. Pick a Technology

Pick an example of an application of crypto and read up on it to the extent that you can explain to others in a small group. Add a brief description covering:

- **What it is**
- **What it is used for**
- **Very roughly how it works**

For example, you could pick a concrete messaging app, or e-voting, or anonymity service, or signature scheme, or identity scheme, or computation on encrypted data, just to name a few (not an exhaustive list).

Submit very short responses to points A, B, and C above, just a sentence or two on each.

### 3. Main Insights from Papers

In bullet points, list the main insights you get from the papers, with reference to the respective paper.

### 4. Implications for Your Technology

In bullet points, list the main implications of the insights when applied to the technology you picked.

### 5. Submission

Upload as PDF and prepare to explain everything to others in group discussions.

## At the Seminar

Participate in group discussions/activities. No preparation other than the above needed.

## If You Cannot Attend the Seminar

Expand on the preparation submission (and upload within two weeks after the seminar):

- Read a paper from a different category than you chose for the preparation, process in the same way as the others
- Write up self-contained text instead of your explanations from point 5) in 2 pages of text, upload as PDF here
