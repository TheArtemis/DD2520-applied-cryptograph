# VSD Exercise: Impact Considerations Seminar Assignment

## Task Overview

This is a short assignment to prepare for the VSD (Values in Design) exercise in the seminar on impact considerations.

## Your Task

Find an example of an application of cryptography that you are **not already using** nor **quite familiar with**. Read up on it to the extent that you can explain to others in a small group:

1. **What is it?**
2. **What is it used for?**
3. **Very roughly how it works?**

## Submission Requirements

Submit very short responses to points 1-3 above—just a **sentence or two on each**.

## Tips for Finding a Topic

- Look into the course literature for cryptography applications
- Search the web for lesser-known or emerging crypto applications
- Choose something that interests you and that you don't already use regularly
- Good candidates include: zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, elliptic curve functions, smart contracts, supply chain verification, privacy-preserving voting systems, or other specialized cryptographic techniques

## Preparation Goals

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Deepen your understanding of cryptography beyond basic applications
- Be prepared to discuss and explain technical concepts to peers
- Contribute meaningful examples to your group discussion in the seminar
